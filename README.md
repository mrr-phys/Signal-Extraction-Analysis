# Signal-Extraction-Analysis
Extracting signal from several generated Heteroscedastic datasets corrupted by noise at different strength.


The folder includes five data files in CSV format in (x; y) pairs. The excersie is to extract the underlying signal among these datasets.
Here I show that FGLS regression model can be the most consistent model for the current input datasets. 

Try it for yourself.
